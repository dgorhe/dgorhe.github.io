<h2>Research Assistant | Jan 2022 — Current</h2>
<h3>Jovanovic Lab @ Columbia University</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Working with protein turnover data to identify differentially expressed proteins and differential complex turnover in primary
    versus metastatic pancreatic cancer cells using Python with the following packages: bokeh, networkx, scipy, pandas,
    matplotlib, numpy.</li>
    <li>Optimized Size-Exclusion Chromatography Toolkit (SECAT) by reducing memory intense data processing and adding
    asynchronous conconcurrency with Python multiprocessing package, and improved the user experience and developer
    experience via conda environments.</li>
    <li>Performing outlier analysis for differentially phosphorylated proteins in primary pancreatic cancer cells versus metastatic
    liver cancer cells using R and Python with the following packages: blacksheep, gseapy, scipy, pandas, numpy, and
    ssGSEA2.0.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Computational Biology Intern | May 2022 — Aug 2022</h2>
<h3>Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Research and Early Development</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented convex optimization based gene prioritization with PyTorch neural network module to explore novel
polygenic risk scoring for Alzheimer’s Disease using 3 data modalities. Worked on a multi-discplinary approach using
molecular biology, computer science, and data science.</li>
    <li>Independently developed graph neural network classifier to determine whether an individual has Alzheimer’s Disease
based on heterogenous graph with 4 node modalities and 3 edge modalities.</li>
    <li>Created machine learning operations (ML Ops) infrastructure to automate graph neural network training, validation,
testing, and inference via PyTorch Lightning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Capstone Project Member | Sep 2022 — Dec 2022</h2>
<h3>Columbia University (Data Science Institute)</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Transformed Jupyter notebooks for scRNA preprocessing and analysis into Python scripts to improve the repro-
ducibility and scalability of NGS analysis.</li>    
    <li>Created Docker containers for CellPhoneDB, Tangram, and SCRAN/Liger analyses to improve the portability of the NGS
analyses across Windows, Linux Servers, and MacOS.</li>    
    <li>Performed CPU and memory profiling via scalene and used insights to make several memory and file I/O improvements
including: vectorizing counts normalization code to improve speed by 98.1%, switching from csv to parquet file format re-
ducing file size by up to 97%, and dynamically switching between regular and compressed sparse row (CSR) representations
based on sparsity of counts matrices.</li>    
</ul>
