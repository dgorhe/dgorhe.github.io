<p>I'm a graduate student at Columbia University in the Master's of Science in Data Science program.
I want to leverage my biology background with data science to help automate and streamline healthcare.
More than anything, I love solving problems with data! I'm applying for internships right now so 
if you need a data science intern, feel free to contact me through any of the links on this page.</p>
